Instructions:

Create a new file and save as conditional_tests.py
Write a series of conditional test and make predictions about their truth value.

Example:

  car = 'subaru'    
  print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict true.")  
  print(car == 'subaru')  
  print("Is car == 'audi'? I predict false.")  
  print(car == 'audi')  
  
Create tests for:
  * equality with strings
  * inequality with strings
  * equality with integers
  * inequality with integers
  * greater than with integers
  * less than with integers
  * conditions using "and"
  * conditions using "or"
  * whether an item is in a list
